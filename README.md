## AI Generated Flashcards (Extended Version)

[Timeboxed README](https://github.com/sajid-sarah/flashcards/blob/timeboxed/README.md)

I built upon the timeboxed version to include the remaining features.
#### 1. Update NotesInput and add NotesList
- Add submit button to save notes and show them in the NotesList.
- Show icon button to generate flashcards for a note.

#### 2. Add Loader
Show a spinning loader when generate frashcards button is clicked until the api response is received, then show the flashcard swiper.

#### 3. UI tweaks
Transfer inline styles to separate css files, add minor styling updates.

#### 4. Deploy using vercel
Login on vercel, set env variable, import github repository, deploy.
